      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Alamin Muhammad, and I am currently a dedicated student at Northwest University Kano, where I am pursuing my studies with a deep sense of purpose and ambition. Ever since my early academic journey, I have been fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities to solve real-life problems and improve lives. This curiosity has driven me to consistently explore the vast world of Information Technology.

        I am an IT expert in the making, learning and growing daily through both structured courses and personal projects. I spend most of my days sharpening my skills in web development, programming, and design, aiming to integrate both technical functionality and beautiful user experience in every project I undertake. My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, React, and Figma, all of which I am continuously expanding upon to remain updated in this fast-evolving tech industry.

        I believe that learning never ends, especially in technology, and I dedicate myself to challenging tasks to enhance my problem-solving abilities. My goal is to become a globally recognised IT professional, developing solutions that impact businesses and societies positively. Outside tech, I enjoy reading motivational books, engaging in productive discussions with mentors and peers, and planning for a future where I contribute to innovative projects across the world.

        This portfolio is a glimpse of my current journey and aspirations, and I look forward to collaborating and connecting with like-minded people to build a better digital world.
